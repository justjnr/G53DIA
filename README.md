Designing Intelligent Agents Module Coursework

Tasked with creating an intelligent agent involving the specification, design and implementation of a simple agent. The problem consists of a 2D environment, in which a single agent must collect and dispose of waste (CO2) from stations, e.g., carbon capture and storage. Stations periodically generate tasks â€“ requests to dispose of a specified amount of waste. The environment also contains a number of wells where waste can be deposited. The goal of the agent is to collect as much waste as possible in a fixed period of time.
